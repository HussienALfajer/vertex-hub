Ship the current branch. Stop and report at the first step that fails.

1. **Branch:** never ship from `main`. If on `main`, create a branch named by type (`feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `docs/`). `TASKS.md` has no open items for this change.
2. **Docs:** update `docs/ROADMAP.md` when a feature or roadmap item is done, and any doc the change made stale (`docs/architecture.md`, a folder `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/open-questions.md`).
3. **Checks:** the required set is lint, typecheck, test and build, plus `e2e` when `apps/web` or `packages/ui` changed and `drift` when `packages/db` changed (against `main`). Run `node scripts/check-record.mjs status <required…>` first:
   - `docs-only: yes` (every change is a Markdown file outside `brand/`): run no checks; CI still runs all of them before the merge.
   - Otherwise run only the checks marked `needed`, through the `checker` subagent, which records what passes. A check marked `recorded` already passed on this exact tree (usually the full run that closed `/feature-slice`); don't repeat it. The fingerprint leaves out Markdown that no check reads (everything but `brand/`), so ticking `TASKS.md` or updating `docs/ROADMAP.md` after that run keeps the record valid.
   Everything must pass. Fix root causes, then run the failing check again. Report which checks ran and which were reused from the record.
4. **Review:** for a feature, the `reviewer` subagent has run and its blocking findings are fixed.
5. **Commit:** stage the intended files only (`git status` first: no `.env`, no reports, no stray files). Conventional Commit subject; body says what and why. End the message with the session's attribution line.
6. **Pull request:** `git push -u origin <branch>`, then `gh pr create --base main` with a body of `## Summary` (what and why, in bullets) and `## Test plan` (the checks, as ticked boxes, each marked as run now or reused from the record on the same tree; for docs only, "documentation only, CI runs the checks"), ending with the session's attribution line. Then `gh pr merge <number> --auto --merge`, never squash or rebase.
7. **Report** in the format from `AGENTS.md`, in Arabic. Put the PR link under Changed, and end "Needs from you" with the cleanup line:
   `cd D:\vertex-hub; git switch main; git pull --ff-only; git branch -d <branch>`
   End with "Next step" as `AGENTS.md` requires: whether the next session needs `/clear`, its model and effort (`docs/workflow.md`), and its exact first message in a code block.
